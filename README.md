Endspect is an app written in R Shiny for exploring gene expression changes throughout the menstrual cycle. This app uses RNA-seq data from 266 endometrial biopsy samples collected from the Royal Women's Hospital. Cycle times were estimated using the [endest](https://github.com/jessicachung/endest) R package.
